I'm Carmen, and I was born in this lovely city calls Barcelona 30 years ago. 
I was all the time in Barcelona? No. With my family I moved at one little town for some years, but now I'm at my favourite city again, in one apartment in the center and near the beach, because is really important to me be close of the see.

From May 2011 I'm in airbnb, and for me is a really nice experience. At home came people from all around the world, and with some of them now we are close friends! I can't forget one men that came from Alaska, and his histories of his life there, or one couple from Australia in their 60's (they were in a tour around europe and he asked her for marriage on the top of Eiffel tower in Paris); or the couple from Japan in their 80's, cooking at home and really surprise for how I do the cuisine. There is lot of people and experience that i will never forget.

I started with airbnb mainly for do one dream: travel around Africa and South America for long time; and now I come from this travel. I started my travel in genuary 2013, and came back in august 2014. But in this time my friend Stefania was at home, welcoming the guests, cleaning, etc. So in the reviews you can see that the people talk about Stefania (well, now again they talk about me). This travel was a really amazing experience, I think that it changed myself. Later I will writte the name of the countries that I been in my life.
What I'm doing now? Well, now I'm thinking what is the life, because we are really lucky (you really can see it if you stay in some parts of africa. I was alone, with my backpack, and stayed with more than 40 families). So, for the moment, I decided finish my studies (antropology) and writte a blog about my travels (to help other people that want to do this kind of travel).  And, of course, continue with airbnb, because I love to meet diferent people, and is also like a travel for me.

See you son!!!

PD: this is the countries that I been in my life, maybe you are from one of them:
